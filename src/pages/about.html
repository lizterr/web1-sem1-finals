            <div class="about-dashboard-item">My name is Lizter. I am a freshman student taking IT in Cristal e-College and I have some knowledge on programming and web design. Some people say I have a lot, but in my opinion, I only have the skills for it to not look bad.</div>
            <div class="about-dashboard-item">I graduated in Central Visayan Institute Foundation from ICT so I know a lot of programming beforehand which is extremely useful when taking IT because it's like, I don't have to worry that much.</div>

        <h1>What do I do?</h1>
        <div class="about-dashboard-grid">
            <div class="about-dashboard-item">I mean, apart from like everything else, I am a pretty decent gamer. I play a lot of indie games and Valve games, play a couple of Minecraft and Terraria. Got some few hundred hours on Counter-Strike, just the average.</div>
            <div class="about-dashboard-item">I play piano and stuff. You probably saw me playing piano, or you didn't. But if you did, I like putting my fingers in keys and seeing them harmonize into a wonderful melody.</div>
            <div class="about-dashboard-item">I am also a little bit of an artist. I don't do much of traditional art, but digitally, I do a lot. And I do like pixel art, which is a part of my finance and stuff.</div>
            <div class="about-dashboard-item">And I also do YouTube, with like minimum pay because everything I upload gets copyright-claimed because all I do now is covers lol.</div>
